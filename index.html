          <h2>Spring</h2>
          <p>
            In the spring, seeds take root and vegetation begins to grow. The
            weather is warmer and often wetter. Animals wake or return from
            warmer climates, often with newborns. Melting snow from the previous
            season, along with increased rainfall, can cause flooding along
            waterways

          <h2>Summer</h2>
          <p>
            In the summer, temperatures may increase to the hottest of the year.
            If they spike too high, heat waves or droughts may cause trouble for
            people, animals, and plants. For example, in the summer of 2003, the
            high temperatures claimed more than 30,000 lives, according to
            Encyclopedia Britannica(opens in new tab). Rainfall may increase in
            some areas, as well. Others may receive less water, and forest fires
            may become more frequent.

          <h2>Autumn(Fall)</h2>
          <p>
            In the autumn, or fall, temperatures cool again. Plants may begin to
            grow dormant. Animals might prepare themselves for the upcoming cold
            weather, storing food or traveling to warmer regions. Various
            cultures have celebrated bountiful harvests with annual festivals.
            Thanksgiving is a good example. "Thanksgiving in the United States
            is a historical commemoration but it has a spiritual dimension
            strongly associated with homecoming and giving praise for what has
            been bestowed upon us," Cristina De Rossi, an anthropologist at
            Barnet and Southgate College in London, told Live Science.

          <h2>Winter</h2>
          <p>
            Winter often brings a chill. Some areas may experience snow or ice,
            while others see only cold rain. Animals find ways to warm
            themselves and may have changed their appearance to adapt. "In a
            similar way to the Autumnal theme, Winter festivals celebrate the
            return of the light during a time of deepest physical darkness,"
            said De Rossi. The Indian festival of Diwali, for example, which
            takes place between October and November, celebrates the triumph of
            righteousness, and light over darkness.
